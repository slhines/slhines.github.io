      <p><em>Natural</em>
      It looked nice for a while, but I wasn't moisturizing it properly so it broke off. Also, kids touched it.
      <em>Crochet</em>
      It was cute, but wasn’t growing. Also, my mom didn’t want to do it.
      <em>Individual Crochet Twists</em>
      I experienced a lot of growth, but it caused my edges to thin out.
      24’’ twists were not easy to dance with.
      <em>Blow drying /straightening</em>
      In between braiding, it allowed my edges to grow back, but it also began training my hair.
      <em>Wig</em>
      I only wore it a few times, but it was a lot of maintenance and was too hot for summer weather.
      <em>Faux locs</em>
      Are currently a work in progress.
